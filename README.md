# contabo-api
## Java 8 Wrapper for the Contabo REST-API using the Guardian Framework

This wrapper makes it easy to use the new [Contabo API](https://api.contabo.com) with Java 8 or higher.

### User-related methods are currently missing, as well as some other convenience methods.
#### All endpoints are implemented; it is possible to use all functionalities of the API. Just not with convenience methods and classes.

Currently, this library can only be obtained via [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#comroid-git/contabo-api)
